# Troubleshooting Vercel Asset 404/Blank Page

If you see 404 errors for CSS/JS after deployment (or a blank page), it is likely due to Vercel serving a cached/stale build. To fix:
- Make a small code change (even a comment) and push to GitHub to trigger a fresh build.
- Ensure your vercel.json rewrite rules are correct (see below).
- Make sure Output Directory is set to `dist` in Vercel settings.
